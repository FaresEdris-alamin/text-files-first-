### Inverted index model 
* list the terms and their document ID
* calculate the frequency of terms
* create a posting list ie. In which file do they are
* do the query using the inverted index model
### Query optimization 
  Start from the smallest term to the largest one
```python
For ch in seq:
   Print("hello world")
```
